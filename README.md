# Project A.L.I.E.N. Expansion, Demo Buttons

<!-- Harry Boyd - 16/08/2024 - github.com/hboyd255 -->

The Project A.L.I.E.N. Main Board has been designed to to take expansion boards.
This utilises the 3 left-over GPIO pins, D11, D12 and D13.

This expansion board provides 3 buttons, each setting the robot to a different
demo mode.
